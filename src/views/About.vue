      <strong>
        Why not using
        <a href="https://explorer.sushipool.com/">SushiPool Explorer</a>/
        <a href="https://nimiq.watch/">Nimiq Watch</a>/etc... instead of this?
      </strong>
      <br>They are awesome tools but doesn't fit what I was looking for.
      <br>Nimiq Watch or other exlorer has too much information,
      <br>SushiPool Explorer was more what I was looking for but the experience on mobile is awful and too complicated.
      <br>Also NIMTE fits more what I need, especially for
      <a href="https://nimiqspin.com/">NimiqSpin</a>.
      <br>

      <strong>Why VueJS?</strong>
      <br>Wanted to learn it and this was the perfect excuse.
