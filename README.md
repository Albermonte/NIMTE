# NIMTE

NIMTE is a Nimiq Transaction Explorer, based on [NimiqX API](https://api.nimiqx.com/docs/about). Keeping it simple.

## Usage

1. Go to https://nimiq-transactions-explorer.netlify.com/
2. Enter the address where the transactions come from on the first input.
3. Enter the address where the transactions have been sended on the second input.
4. Click on "Submit" and wait a few seconds.

## Why?

**Why not using [SushiPool Explorer](https://explorer.sushipool.com/)/[Nimiq Watch](https://nimiq.watch/)/etc... instead of this?**

They are awesome tools but doesn't fit what I was looking for. 

Nimiq Watch or other exlporer has too much information,

SushiPool Explorer was more what I was looking for but the experience on mobile is awful and too complicated.

Also NIMTE fits more what I need, especially for [NimiqSpin](https://nimiqspin.com/).

**Why VueJS?**

Wanted to learn it and this was the perfect excuse.

**Can I contribute?**

Of course, pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

**Your code is horrible**

I know, I try my best but...
